### A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.

Burger is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM.  It allows a user to add a burger by entering it in the form field, and then allows them to choose to either 'devour it' or 'serve it' again.

## Motivation
Burger is a full-stack app, which complies with the guidelines of:
* Utilizing npm packages to access and format data.
* Establishing a package.json for npm package version info and install requirements.
* Using Express for server functionality.
* It follows the Model, View, Controller (MVC) design pattern
* Uses Node and MySQL to query and route data
* Uses Handlebars to generate HTML
* Deploying to GitHub.
* Deploying to Heroku.
